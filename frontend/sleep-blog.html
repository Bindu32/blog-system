        A restful night‚Äôs sleep is vital for our physical, emotional, and mental well-being. In a world of constant digital distractions and daily stressors, establishing a bedtime routine can help our bodies and minds transition smoothly into deep rest. One of the most effective steps is to create a consistent sleep schedule. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day helps regulate your circadian rhythm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reducing screen time an hour before bed is equally important. The blue light from phones and laptops interferes with melatonin, the hormone responsible for sleep. Instead, consider reading a physical book, practicing meditation, or listening to calming music. Many people find that journaling before bed helps release the thoughts of the day, making it easier to relax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other beneficial rituals include taking a warm shower, doing light stretching, and using essential oils like lavender or eucalyptus. These activities signal to your brain that it‚Äôs time to unwind. Creating a soothing sleep environment‚Äîdim lighting, cool temperature, and comfortable bedding‚Äîcan also greatly improve your sleep quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        When practiced consistently, these nighttime rituals can lead to better sleep hygiene, reduced stress, and more productive mornings. They are small yet powerful habits that promote long-term health and a peaceful state of mind.
